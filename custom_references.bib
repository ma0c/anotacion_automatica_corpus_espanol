The CIEMPIESS corpus was designed to be used in the field of automatic speech recongnition (ASR) and it is provided with two different kind of pronouncing dictionaries, one of them containing the phonemes of Mexican Spanish and the other containing this same phonemes plus allophones. Corpus annotation took into account the tonic vowel of every word and the four different sounds that letter {``}x{''} presents in the Spanish language. CIEMPIESS corpus is also provided with two different language models extracted from electronic newsletters, one of them takes into account the tonic vowels but not the other one.
